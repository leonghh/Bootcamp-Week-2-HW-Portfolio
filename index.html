                <p>I am 25 years old and from Singapore and have came to Australia for my Bachelor's Degree. The degree
                    i was undertaking was a Bachelor of Business Degree in International Hotel and Resort Management. I
                    have just graduated and am currently attending a coding bootcamp organised by Trilogy at University
                    of Sydney. I was just working part time after my graduation but i got boring really quick. I wanted
                    to look for something to entertain myself and that was when i saw the advertisement for the coding
                    bootcamp. I don't have alot to say about myself so here is an article about digital media use and
                    mental health i was reading about on Wikipedia.</p>

                <p>The relationships between digital media use and mental health have been investigated by various
                    researchers—predominantly psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, and medical
                    experts—especially since the mid-1990s, after the growth of the World Wide Web. A significant body
                    of research has explored "overuse" phenomena, commonly known as "digital addictions", or "digital
                    dependencies". These phenomena manifest differently in many societies and cultures. Some experts
                    have investigated the benefits of moderate digital media use in various domains, including in mental
                    health, and the treatment of mental health problems with novel technological solutions.</p>

                <p>The delineation between beneficial and pathological use of digital media has not been established.
                    There are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria, although some experts consider overuse a
                    manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. The prevention and treatment of pathological
                    digital media use is also not standardised, although guidelines for safer media use for children and
                    families have been developed. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
                    Edition (DSM-5) does not include diagnoses for problematic internet use, problematic social media
                    use, and gaming disorder (commonly known as video game addiction), whereas the eleventh revision of
                    the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) recognises gaming disorder. Experts are still
                    debating how and when to diagnose these conditions. The use of the term addiction to refer to these
                    phenomena and diagnoses has also been questioned.</p>

                <p>Digital media and screen time have changed how children think, interact and develop in positive and
                    negative ways, but scientists are unsure about the existence of hypothesised causal links between
                    digital media use and mental health outcomes. Those links appear to depend on the individual and the
                    platforms they use. Several large technology firms have made commitments or announced strategies to
                    try to reduce the risks of digital media use.</p>
